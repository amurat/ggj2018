Controls: Left + Right Arrows to move; 1, 2, 3 to fire different colored arrows (green, red, brown)



Two battalions are losing confidence as the attacks on the town are delayed. Once both battalions are disheartened the game is over. The goal of the game is to shoot down carrier pigeons with arrows that match the same colors as the birds. 

But there is a catch: each bird that gets through boosts the confidence meter. If it's high enough, the game has 10 seconds before it ends. You can still win as long as the other army doesn't attack at the same time. 

Let enough birds through to keep the armies from retreating and maximize your score. But don't let them get bold enough to attack you!





Notes: Press R to reset. game delivers end messages but doesn't reset. Different colors don't mean anything except the arrows only shoot down birds that are the same color.
